	abstract = {Recent advances in technologies for global mapping of alternative polyadenylation (APA) have allowed unprecedented investigation of alternative polyadenylation in biological processes.Broad APA modulation has been identified in development and cellular differentiation: in general in systems characterized thus far, development is accompanied by a progressive lengthening of 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) and use of distal poly(A) sites.Cellular proliferation is associated with a use of shift towards proximal poly(A) sites.APA may be regulated by the level of 3′ end machinery expression, interplay with transcription, splicing and potentially chromatin.APA misregulation has been identified in human disease, and APA is potentially a therapeutic target.},
